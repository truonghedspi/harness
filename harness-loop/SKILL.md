description: >-
  Set up a complete agent harness AND an autonomous maker–checker loop on top of any project,
  targeting Kiro (kiro-cli). Scaffolds AGENTS.md, feature_list.json, init.sh, progress.md,
  DECISIONS.md, session-handoff.md, docs/ topic files, tools/trace.mjs observability, and a
  loop/ (goal + maker/checker prompts + run-loop.sh) plus .kiro/ custom agents. Every artifact
  maps to one of the 13 Learn-Harness-Engineering lessons, and a bundled coverage checker proves
  all 13 are present and their gates pass. Use whenever a coding agent needs to run reliably
  across sessions and then run autonomously (unattended) — forgets context, drifts scope, claims
  "done" too early, or you want to move from prompting the agent to designing a loop that prompts it.

# Harness Loop

Turn any repository into a project an agent can (1) work in reliably across sessions, and (2)
run **autonomously** in a maker–checker loop — with a machine-checkable guarantee that all 13
Learn-Harness-Engineering lessons are covered.

Two floors, built in order:

- **Floor 1 — Harness (Lessons 1–12):** make a *single* agent run reliable. Instructions, state,
  verification, scope, lifecycle, observability, clean-state.
- **Floor 2 — Loop (Lesson 13):** make *continuous* runs autonomous. A goal + verification +
  stopping condition, a maker/checker split (generator/evaluator separation), and an automation
  that fires it. The loop stands on the harness — never build Floor 2 without Floor 1 green.

Not for: model selection, prompt tuning in isolation, chat-UI design, or general app
architecture. Keep project-specific facts in the target repo, not in this skill.

## The 13-lesson coverage contract

This is the spine of the skill. Every lesson maps to a concrete artifact and a machine check.
The bundled `check-coverage.mjs` verifies each row — that is how "all 13 lessons are covered"
becomes a fact you can prove, not a claim.

| # | Lesson (why X fails) | Artifact scaffolded | Machine check |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Capable models still fail (harness-induced) → Definition of Done + diagnostic loop | `docs/definition-of-done.md`, DoD section in `AGENTS.md` | DoD doc present; AGENTS.md links it |
| 2 | Five subsystems must all exist | `AGENTS.md`+env manifest+`progress.md`+`init.sh` (instructions/tools/env/state/feedback) | all five markers detected |
| 3 | Repo = single source of truth → Fresh Session Test | `docs/architecture.md` answering the 5 questions | doc answers What/How-organized/Run/Verify/Where-now |
| 4 | One giant instruction file fails → router + topic docs | short `AGENTS.md` (≤200 lines) linking `docs/*.md` | AGENTS.md within budget AND links topic docs |
| 5 | Long tasks lose continuity → external state | `progress.md` + `DECISIONS.md` + clock-in/out in `init.sh`/`AGENTS.md` | both files present; AGENTS.md has clock-in/out |
| 6 | Init needs its own phase → readiness checklist | Startup Readiness section in `AGENTS.md`; runnable `init.sh` | init.sh executable; readiness section present |
| 7 | Overreach/under-finish → WIP=1 + executable completion evidence | Work Rules (WIP=1) in `AGENTS.md`; `state` per feature | WIP=1 rule present |
| 8 | Feature lists are harness primitives → triple + 4-state | `feature_list.json` (behavior+verification+state+evidence) | every feature has verification + valid state |
| 9 | Declaring victory too early → externalized termination | `loop/checker-prompt.md`; only checker/script flips `passing`/`done` | checker artifact present; features carry `evidence` |
| 10 | Only full-pipeline runs count → cross-service integration gates | `docs/testing-standards.md` (3 levels, top = microservice integration/contract); `init.sh` runs build+test | testing doc has 3 levels incl. microservice integration; init runs pipeline |
| 11 | Observability belongs in the harness | `tools/trace.mjs` + `trace/`; agent `hooks` emit trace | trace.mjs present; agents reference it |
| 12 | Every session must leave clean state → exit checklist | Session-exit 5-condition checklist in `AGENTS.md`; `session-handoff.md` | exit checklist present; handoff file present |
| 13 | Manual prompting → autonomous loop | `loop/goal.md` (goal+verification+stop), maker/checker prompts, `run-loop.sh`, `.kiro/agents/*.json` | all loop artifacts present; goal.md has stop conditions |

Full spec (what each check inspects, exactly) lives in
[references/13-lesson-coverage.md](references/13-lesson-coverage.md) — it is the contract
`check-coverage.mjs` implements.

## Setup workflow

1. **Inspect the target.** Detect stack/package manager, existing `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`,
   any feature/state files, and the real verification commands. Never overwrite silently.
2. **Ask only what can't be inferred:** target agent file name (`AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md`),
   one-line project purpose, whether overwriting existing harness files is allowed, and whether
   the loop should run local (`kiro-cli` on this machine) or headless (CI/cron).
3. **Scaffold Floor 1 + Floor 2** with the bundled script:

   ```bash
   node harness-loop/scripts/setup-harness-loop.mjs --target /path/to/project
   ```

   Options: `--agent-file CLAUDE.md`, `--package-manager npm|pnpm|yarn|bun`,
   `--commands "cmd one,cmd two"` (override detected verification), `--name "Project X"`,
   `--purpose "one line"`, `--force` (only after the user OKs overwrites).

4. **Fill the placeholders with the user.** Replace the placeholder features in
   `feature_list.json` with real ones (each needs a runnable `verification`), and the goal in
   `loop/goal.md` with the project's real objective + stopping condition. This is the step that
   makes the loop actually do the user's work — do not leave placeholders.
5. **Get the baseline green.** Run `./init.sh` in the target. If red, that is the only work until
   it is green (Lesson 6/9). A loop on a red baseline just amplifies failure.
6. **Prove coverage:**

   ```bash
   node harness-loop/scripts/check-coverage.mjs --target /path/to/project
   ```

   Report the per-lesson scorecard, the lowest-covered lessons, and the first 2–3 fixes. Do not
   tell the user "all 13 are covered" until this passes — that is the whole point of the skill.
7. **Start the loop only after coverage passes and the baseline is green.** Local first:
   `kiro-cli chat --agent maker` then `--agent checker`; or headless `loop/run-loop.sh N`.
   Begin at maturity Level 1 (one `/goal`-style run) and climb the ladder — see
   [references/loop-engineering.md](references/loop-engineering.md).

## Design rules (do not violate)

- **Floor 1 before Floor 2.** Never wire a loop onto a harness whose baseline is red or whose
  coverage check fails. The loop inherits every weakness underneath it.
- **The maker never grades itself.** `status: done` is the checker's decision alone (Lesson 9/13,
  generator/evaluator separation). Keep the maker write-broad and the checker write-restricted to
  state files, exactly as the `.kiro/agents/*.json` templates do.
- **Stopping conditions are machine-checkable**, never "looks right" (Lesson 10; Four Silent
  Costs → verification debt). Every feature's `verification` must be a real command.
- **Keep the router short.** `AGENTS.md` routes and states invariants; project facts go in
  `docs/*.md` (Lesson 4). Do not grow it into a manual.
- **Externalize memory.** State lives in `progress.md`/`feature_list.json`/`trace/`, never only
  in chat (Lesson 5/13 External State).
- **Human checkpoints stay human.** Exclusion approvals, ambiguous requirements, and any
  irreversible/production action are stop conditions in `loop/goal.md`, never automated.
- **Never hide destructive behavior in scaffolding.** Overwrites require explicit user approval
  (`--force`).

## Deliverable checklist

After setup, the target project should contain:

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) — router with DoD, Startup Readiness, Work Rules (WIP=1),
      clock-in/out, and session-exit checklist
- [ ] `feature_list.json` — features with the behavior+verification+state+evidence triple
- [ ] `init.sh` — baseline gate running the real verification pipeline
- [ ] `progress.md` + `DECISIONS.md` — external state
- [ ] `session-handoff.md` — lifecycle handoff
- [ ] `docs/{architecture,constraints,testing-standards,definition-of-done}.md`
- [ ] `tools/trace.mjs` + `trace/` — observability
- [ ] `loop/{goal.md,maker-prompt.md,checker-prompt.md,run-loop.sh}`
- [ ] `.kiro/agents/{maker,checker,harness-setup}.json` (+ `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
- [ ] `check-coverage.mjs` reports all 13 lessons covered, and `./init.sh` is green

If you cannot write files, output the exact file contents and commands instead.
